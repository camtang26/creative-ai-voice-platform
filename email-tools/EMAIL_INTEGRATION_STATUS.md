# Email Integration Status

## Current Status

The email integration is now working with the following status:

- ✅ Email API endpoint is functional
- ✅ New Investor Signals REST API implementation is the primary method
- ✅ AWS SES API implementation is used as a secondary fallback
- ✅ Email fallback to test account is the final fallback option
- ❌ Original AWS SES SMTP connection was failing due to network/platform restrictions

## Implementation Changes

We've made key implementation changes to address the email sending issues:

### Current Approach (REST API) - Recommended
We're now using the Investor Signals REST API endpoint provided by Craig:
- Uses standard HTTPS (port 443) which is rarely blocked
- Simplest and most reliable approach
- Automatically branded with Investor Signals header/footer
- No need for AWS SES credentials or configuration

### Secondary Approach (AWS SES API) - Fallback
If the REST API fails, we try the AWS SES API approach which:
- Also uses standard HTTPS (port 443) 
- Bypasses SMTP restrictions
- Requires proper AWS IAM credentials

### Final Fallback (Ethereal Test Email)
If both approaches above fail, the system can fall back to a test email service:
- Emails aren't actually delivered but can be viewed via a test interface
- Allows for checking the content of emails during development
- Enabled via the `EMAIL_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true` setting

### Old Approach (SMTP) - No Longer Used
Originally, we were using AWS SES via SMTP (ports 25, 465, 587) which is frequently blocked by:
- ISPs (home internet providers)
- Cloud/serverless hosting platforms
- Corporate firewalls

## REST API Endpoint Details

The Investor Signals REST API endpoint:
- Endpoint: `https://qr4h1dage6.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/notices/email`
- Method: POST
- Body Format:
  ```json
  {
    "to": "email@address.com",
    "subject": "Email Subject",
    "plain": "Plain text email version", 
    "html": "HTML formatted email"
  }
  ```
- Automatically adds the Investor Signals branding to the email
- Always sends from info@investorsignals.com

## Next Steps

1. **Test the New API Implementation**:
   ```bash
   node test-api-email.js
   ```

2. **Verify in Production**:
   - Try sending real emails via the server endpoint
   - Check that the email arrives with proper formatting
   - Verify that the Investor Signals branding is applied

3. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Consider adding additional metadata to the API call
   - Implement analytics/tracking for email opens and clicks
   - Explore additional customization options with Craig
