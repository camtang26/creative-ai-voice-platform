# Email Integration Guidelines for AI Agent

## Overview

This guide provides instructions on how to effectively use the email capability during conversations with customers. The email functionality allows you to send professionally formatted emails with Investor Signals branding to customers directly from your conversation.

## When to Offer Email

Consider offering to send an email in these scenarios:

1. **Customer explicitly requests information by email**
   - Example: "Can you email me that information?"
   - Example: "I'd like to have this in writing."

2. **Complex information that's difficult to convey verbally**
   - Investment options with multiple data points
   - Lists of resources or references
   - Step-by-step instructions

3. **Follow-up after the call**
   - Summarizing key points discussed
   - Providing additional resources
   - Confirming next steps

4. **Documentation or verification**
   - When the customer needs a record of the information
   - For information that requires careful review

## How to Offer Email in Conversation

When offering to send an email, be natural and conversational:

✅ Good approach:
"Would you like me to send you an email with these details so you have them for reference?"

✅ Good approach:
"I can summarize this information in an email for you if that would be helpful. What email address should I use?"

❌ Avoid:
"I will now utilize the email functionality to transmit the specified information to your electronic mail address."

## Collecting Email Addresses

Always ask for permission and the email address:

1. "Would it be helpful if I sent you an email with this information?"
2. "What email address would you like me to use?"
3. Confirm the email address by repeating it back: "Just to confirm, I'll send this to john.smith@example.com. Is that correct?"

## Creating Effective Email Content

### Subject Lines
Use clear, specific subject lines that indicate the purpose:
- "Your Investment Options from Our Call Today"
- "Requested Information: Retirement Planning Options"
- "Summary of Our Discussion on Portfolio Diversification"

### Email Structure
Structure emails for easy readability:
1. **Greeting**: Use the customer's name if available
2. **Introduction**: Brief reminder of the conversation context
3. **Main Content**: Well-structured with headings, bullet points, etc.
4. **Closing**: Next steps or call to action
5. **Sign-off**: Professional closing

### HTML Formatting
You can use basic HTML tags to format the email:
- `<h1>`, `<h2>` for headings
- `<p>` for paragraphs
- `<ul>` and `<li>` for bullet points
- `<strong>` for bold text
- `<em>` for italics
- `<a href="...">` for links

### Example HTML Email Structure

```html
<h2>Thank you for our conversation today</h2>

<p>As we discussed, here are the three investment options that might suit your goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Growth Portfolio</strong> - Higher risk, potentially higher returns</li>
  <li><strong>Balanced Portfolio</strong> - Moderate risk and returns</li>
  <li><strong>Income Portfolio</strong> - Lower risk, focus on steady income</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on your stated goal of retirement in 15 years with moderate risk tolerance, the <strong>Balanced Portfolio</strong> appears most aligned with your needs.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>If you'd like to proceed with any of these options or have additional questions, please:</p>

  <li>Reply to this email</li>
  <li>Call our office at 1300 614 002</li>
  <li>Schedule a follow-up call via our website</li>
</ol>
```

## After Sending an Email

Always confirm when the email has been sent and set expectations:

✅ Good approach:
"I've sent the email to john@example.com. It should arrive in your inbox shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?"

✅ Good approach:
"The email with the investment summary has been sent. Please note that the email comes from info@investorsignals.com and includes our company branding. Is there anything in particular you'd like me to clarify from the email?"

## Troubleshooting

If the customer mentions they haven't received the email:

1. Verify the email address is correct
2. Suggest checking spam/junk folders
3. Offer to resend if necessary
4. Provide alternative options if email delivery is problematic
