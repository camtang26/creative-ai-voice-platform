# Fixed Deployment Guide for US-East Region

I've fixed the issues with the original deployment. Now we need to:

1. **Add Missing Dependencies**: The error was due to missing `nodemailer` and `@aws-sdk/client-ses` packages.
2. **Force US-East Region**: Added configuration files to ensure deployment to US-East.

## Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

1. **Navigate to the deployment package**:
   ```bash
   cd deployment/railway-package
   ```

2. **Deploy to US-East Region**:
   ```bash
   set RAILWAY_REGION=us-east-1
   railway up --region us-east-1
   ```

3. **Get Your Domain**:
   ```bash
   railway domain
   ```
   Write down the domain (should look like `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`)

4. **Set SERVER_URL Environment Variable**:
   ```bash
   railway variables --set "SERVER_URL=https://your-app-name.up.railway.app"
   ```
   (Replace with your actual domain from step 3)

5. **Redeploy to Apply SERVER_URL**:
   ```bash
   railway up --region us-east-1
   ```

6. **Verify Deployment**:
   Open your domain in a browser to confirm the server is running

7. **Test with Make-Call**:
   ```bash
   node make-call.js +1234567890 "Default prompt" "Default message" https://your-app-name.up.railway.app
   ```

8. **Update Twilio Webhook URLs**:
   Log in to your Twilio account and update the webhook URLs to point to your new domain.

## Alternatively, Use the Automated Script

I've created an automated deployment script:

```bash
# For Windows
deploy.bat

# For Unix/Linux/Mac
bash deploy.sh
```

This script will handle all the deployment steps automatically.

## Fixed Issues

1. Missing Dependencies:
   - Added `nodemailer` and `@aws-sdk/client-ses` to package.json

2. Region Configuration:
   - Added `.region`, `railway.json`, and `.railwayrc` files to force US-East deployment

3. Main Configuration:
   - Fixed package.json to use `server.js` as main entry point
   - Included all required dependencies

Your deployment should now work correctly with the full email functionality and be hosted in the US-East region for lower latency.
