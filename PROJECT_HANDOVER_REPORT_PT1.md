# Project Handover Report: ElevenLabs Conversational AI & Twilio Integration

**Date of Report:** 2025-05-12
**Purpose:** To provide a comprehensive overview of the project status, architecture, ongoing challenges, and development history for a seamless handover to a new AI assistant instance.

## 1. Project Overview & Goals

The core objective of this project is to build an advanced conversational AI system. Key functionalities include:

*   **Telephony Integration:** Leveraging Twilio for handling inbound and outbound calls.
*   **AI Conversation & Analysis:** Utilizing ElevenLabs for voice synthesis, and potentially for speech-to-text and further call analysis.
*   **Data Management:** Storing all relevant call data (metadata, Twilio recordings, ElevenLabs transcripts, analysis results) in a MongoDB database.
*   **Webhook Handling:** Processing real-time events from ElevenLabs and Twilio via webhooks.
*   **Frontend Interface:** A Next.js/React application to display call logs, call details (including transcripts and analysis), allow playback and download of recordings, manage campaigns, and view analytics.
*   **Real-time Capabilities:** Using Socket.IO for real-time updates on the frontend (e.g., live call monitoring).

## 2. Current System Architecture

*   **Backend:**
    *   Framework: Node.js with Fastify ([`server-mongodb.js`](./server-mongodb.js))
    *   Database: MongoDB (Mongoose ODM - models in [`db/models/`](./db/models), repositories in [`db/repositories/`](./db/repositories))
    *   API Structure: RESTful APIs for various entities (calls, recordings, transcripts, etc.) defined in [`db/api/`](./db/api) and registered via [`db/index.js`](./db/index.js).
    *   Webhook Handling: Specific handlers for ElevenLabs ([`db/webhook-handler-db.js`](./db/webhook-handler-db.js)) and potentially Twilio.
    *   Real-time: `fastify-socket.io` for client-facing Socket.IO; a separate `ws` server was historically used for Twilio media streams due to past conflicts.
    *   Authentication: Google OAuth was partially implemented ([`google-auth.js`](./google-auth.js)). Direct Twilio API access from the backend is authenticated using Account SID/Auth Token.
*   **Frontend:**
    *   Framework: Next.js with React (project root: [`frontend/`](./frontend))
    *   UI Components: Shadcn UI components (in [`frontend/src/components/ui/`](./frontend/src/components/ui)), custom components for application features.
    *   State Management: React Context API (e.g., [`frontend/src/lib/socket-context.tsx`](./frontend/src/lib/socket-context.tsx)).
    *   API Interaction: Fetches data from the backend via relative API paths.
*   **Deployment:**
    *   Primary: Render
    *   Secondary (for testing): Railway
    *   Version Control: Git, repository hosted on GitHub (e.g., `camtang26/investorsignals-conversational-agent`).

## 3. Key Modules & Functionalities Implemented

*   **MongoDB Integration:** Schema design, connection, basic CRUD operations for calls, recordings, transcripts.
*   **ElevenLabs Webhook Handling:** Initial signature verification issues were resolved. Webhooks now process, fetch data from ElevenLabs API, and save transcripts/calls to MongoDB.
*   **Twilio Call Handling (Basic):** Outbound call initiation ([`make-call.js`](./make-call.js)), call event logging.
*   **Recording Proxy:** Backend route intended to securely stream Twilio recordings to the frontend.
*   **Frontend UI (Partial):**
    *   Call Logs Page ([`frontend/src/app/call-logs/page.tsx`](./frontend/src/app/call-logs/page.tsx))
    *   Recordings Page ([`frontend/src/app/recordings/page.tsx`](./frontend/src/app/recordings/page.tsx))
    *   Call Details Page ([`frontend/src/app/call-details/[id]/page.tsx`](./frontend/src/app/call-details/[id]/page.tsx))
    *   Various UI components for displaying data and interacting with the system.

## 4. Major Unresolved Issue: Recording Download/Playback (404 Errors)

This has been the most significant and persistent challenge. A detailed report on this specific issue is available in [`DEBUGGING_SUMMARY_RECORDING_DOWNLOAD.md`](./DEBUGGING_SUMMARY_RECORDING_DOWNLOAD.md).

**Summary of the Problem:**
*   The backend proxy route `/api/recordings/:recordingSid/download`, designed to securely fetch and stream Twilio recordings, consistently fails.
*   **On Render:** Requests to this route result in a 404 error *before* reaching the Fastify application. Other API routes, including similar parameterized ones, work correctly.
*   **On Railway:** After aligning Fastify dependencies to v4 (`fastify@^4.29.0`), requests *do* reach the Fastify application but still result in a Fastify-generated 404 "Route not found" error, meaning the router fails to match the request to the defined handler.
*   This failure prevents both downloading recordings and playing them back in the frontend audio players.
