# Recording Download Fix Report

## Issue Summary

The project encountered significant issues with Twilio call recording downloads, specifically:

1. **Primary Issue (Render Deployment)**: Requests to `/api/recordings/:recordingSid/download` resulted in 404 errors, with requests not reaching the Fastify application.

2. **Secondary Issue (Railway Deployment)**: After aligning Fastify dependencies, requests reached the application but resulted in 404 "Route not found" errors from Fastify itself.

3. **User Experience Impact**: Audio files couldn't be played in the Call Details page or downloaded for offline use.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issues stemmed from:

1. **Platform Limitations**: Render appears to block or filter certain types of streaming responses, particularly when proxying binary audio data from external APIs.

2. **Routing Inconsistencies**: The route was registered but not matched properly in certain environments, suggesting subtle URL parsing or parameter handling differences.

3. **Browser Compatibility**: Direct streaming of audio data with certain headers caused browser compatibility issues.

## Solution Implemented

We implemented a comprehensive server-side file caching solution:

### 1. Created a Recording Cache Utility (`db/utils/recording-cache.js`)
- Manages downloading and caching of Twilio recordings
- Stores files in the server's temporary directory
- Provides utilities for checking cache status and MIME type handling
- Handles file I/O operations and error recovery

### 2. Enhanced API Routes (`db/api/recording-api.js`)
- Improved original `/api/recordings/:recordingSid/download` endpoint to use file caching
- Added alternate route `/api/media/recordings/:recordingSid` with simplified headers
- Retained backward compatibility with existing routes
- Added proper error handling and logging

### 3. Updated Frontend Components
- Modified Call Details page to use the enhanced media endpoint for streaming
- Updated download links to use the appropriate endpoints
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

## Technical Details

### Cache Mechanism

The caching system:
1. Checks if a recording is already cached
2. If not, downloads it from Twilio using account credentials
3. Saves to a temporary directory
4. Serves subsequent requests from the file system
5. Uses appropriate Content-Type headers based on file type

### API Endpoints

We maintained multiple endpoints for flexibility:

| Endpoint | Purpose | Headers | Best For |
|----------|---------|---------|----------|
| `/api/recordings/:recordingSid/download` | Downloading | Content-Disposition: attachment | Direct downloads |
| `/api/media/recordings/:recordingSid` | Streaming | Content-Type only | Audio players |
| `/api/recordings/data/:recordingSid` | Base64 Data | JSON with base64 | Legacy support |

### Testing

A comprehensive test script (`test-recording-caching.js`) was created to verify:
- Direct cache functionality
- Media endpoint streaming
- Download endpoint functionality

## Benefits

1. **Platform Compatibility**: Works across hosting platforms by avoiding direct streaming
2. **Performance**: Faster subsequent requests due to caching
3. **Reliability**: More consistent user experience
4. **Maintenance**: Cleaner code with better error handling

## Recommendations

1. **Monitoring**: Watch for cache directory size growth over time
2. **Future Enhancement**: Implement cache expiration for unused recordings
3. **Documentation**: Update API docs to recommend using `/api/media/recordings/:recordingSid` for streaming

## Conclusion

The implemented solution resolves the recording download issues by fundamentally changing how audio data is served. Instead of direct proxying, we now use a file-based caching approach that's more compatible with hosting platforms and browser implementations.
