# Dashboard Real-time Data Fix Summary

## Issue
The frontend dashboard was showing all zeros for metrics despite Socket.IO connecting successfully. The console showed "Dashboard summary data not available, using defaults".

## Root Cause
The backend API (`/api/db/analytics/dashboard`) was returning data in a different structure than what the frontend expected:

### Backend was returning:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "calls": {
      "total": 249,
      "byStatus": [...],
      "avgDuration": 1,
      "totalDuration": 235,
      "successRate": 0,
      "trend": {...}
    }
  }
}
```

### Frontend expected:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "summary": {
      "totalCalls": 249,
      "activeCalls": 0,
      "completedCalls": 0,
      "failedCalls": 248,
      "totalDuration": 235,
      "averageDuration": 1,
      "successRate": 0,
      "trend": {...}
    }
  }
}
```

## Solution
Fixed the data transformation in `frontend/src/lib/dashboard-api.ts`:

1. Added transformation logic to convert backend response format to frontend expected format
2. The `fetchDashboardOverview()` function now properly maps:
   - `backendData.calls.total` → `summary.totalCalls`
   - `backendData.calls.avgDuration` → `summary.averageDuration`
   - `backendData.calls.totalDuration` → `summary.totalDuration`
   - `backendData.calls.successRate` → `summary.successRate`
   - Calculates completed/failed/active calls from `byStatus` array

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/lib/dashboard-api.ts`: Added data transformation logic in `fetchDashboardOverview()`

## Result
The dashboard should now display the correct metrics from the production backend instead of showing all zeros.

## Additional Notes
- The backend is deployed on Render.com at `https://twilio-elevenlabs-app.onrender.com`
- The frontend is configured to use this production URL via `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `.env.local`
- Socket.IO connections are working correctly (as shown by the "Live" status)
- The issue was purely a data format mismatch between backend and frontend
