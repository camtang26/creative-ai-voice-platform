# Phased Package Update Plan

## Summary
This document outlines a phased approach to updating packages with major version changes to minimize risk and ensure stability.

## Current Status
- ✅ Removed node-fetch dependency (using native fetch in Node.js v22)
- ✅ Resolved all security vulnerabilities with npm audit fix
- 0 vulnerabilities in both backend and frontend

## Phase 1: Low-Risk Minor Updates (Immediate)
These can be updated immediately as they are backward compatible:

### Backend
```bash
npm update @aws-sdk/client-ses axios dotenv nodemon open tailwind-merge ws
```

### Frontend  
```bash
npm update @radix-ui/react-checkbox @radix-ui/react-dialog @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu @radix-ui/react-label @radix-ui/react-popover @radix-ui/react-radio-group @radix-ui/react-select @radix-ui/react-slider @radix-ui/react-slot @radix-ui/react-tabs @radix-ui/react-toast dotenv react-day-picker react-hook-form recharts wavesurfer.js zod typescript postcss
```

## Phase 2: Medium-Risk Updates (Week 1)
These require testing but should be compatible:

### Backend
- **mongoose** 7.x → 8.x
  - Review breaking changes in migration guide
  - Test all database operations
  - Check model definitions and queries

### Frontend
- **lucide-react** 0.510.0 → 0.515.0
  - Test all icon components
  - Verify no visual regressions

## Phase 3: High-Risk Major Updates (Week 2-3)
These require significant testing and may need code changes:

### Backend
1. **Fastify Ecosystem** (coordinate updates together)
   - fastify 4.x → 5.x
   - @fastify/cors 8.x → 11.x
   - @fastify/formbody 7.x → 8.x
   - @fastify/helmet 11.x → 13.x
   - @fastify/multipart 8.x → 9.x
   - Review Fastify v5 migration guide
   - Test all API endpoints
   - Update plugin configurations

2. **twilio** 4.x → 5.x
   - Review Twilio SDK v5 migration guide
   - Test all phone operations
   - Verify webhook handling

3. **express** 4.x → 5.x (if needed)
   - Currently using Fastify, may not be critical
   - Consider removing if not used

### Frontend
1. **Next.js Ecosystem**
   - next 14.x → 15.x
   - eslint-config-next 14.x → 15.x
   - Review Next.js 15 migration guide
   - Test all pages and API routes
   - Check for deprecated features

2. **React Ecosystem** (defer to Phase 4)
   - React 18 → 19 is very new
   - Wait for ecosystem stability

## Phase 4: Future Updates (Month 2+)
Monitor ecosystem maturity before updating:

### Frontend
- **React** 18.x → 19.x
- **@types/react** 18.x → 19.x
- **@types/react-dom** 18.x → 19.x
- **tailwindcss** 3.x → 4.x
- **eslint** 8.x → 9.x
- **date-fns** 3.x → 4.x
- **next-themes** 0.2.x → 0.4.x

## Testing Strategy

### For Each Phase:
1. Create feature branch from security-and-package-updates
2. Update packages in the phase
3. Run comprehensive tests:
   - Unit tests (if available)
   - API endpoint tests
   - Frontend component tests
   - End-to-end functionality tests
4. Deploy to staging environment
5. Perform user acceptance testing
6. Merge to main branch

### Critical Test Areas:
- Phone validation and calling functionality
- Campaign management operations
- Contact CRUD operations
- Real-time updates (Socket.IO)
- Database operations (MongoDB)
- Authentication and security
- UI/UX consistency

## Rollback Plan
- Each phase is in a separate git branch
- Can revert to previous commits if issues arise
- Keep package-lock.json backups before major updates

## Monitoring
After each phase deployment:
- Monitor error logs for 24-48 hours
- Check performance metrics
- Gather user feedback
- Review crash reports

## Notes
- googleapis has many versions ahead but is stable at current version
- nodemailer 6.x → 7.x can wait as email is not critical path
- Always test Twilio integration thoroughly as it's business critical
