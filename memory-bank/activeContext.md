## Recent Changes

*
*   [2025-05-13 15:20:00] - Successfully debugged and fixed CSV campaign creation and campaign details page.
    - Resolved Fastify version mismatch for `@fastify/multipart`.
    - Corrected frontend logic for `useState` in `make-call/page.tsx` (added "use client").
    - Fixed `formData` population in `upload-sheet-form.tsx` to correctly send campaign details.
    - Adjusted `@fastify/multipart` configuration in `server-mongodb.js` for `request.parts()`.
    - Corrected Mongoose validation error for campaign status (changed 'pending' to 'draft').
    - Fixed `_id` to `id` mapping in `fetchCampaigns` and `fetchCampaign` in `frontend/src/lib/mongodb-api.ts`.
    - Corrected nested data unwrapping in `fetchCampaign`.
    - Campaign Details page now loads dummy data.
*   [2025-05-13 15:20:00] - Current Focus: Shifted to implementing a new post-call webhook for CRM integration.
*   [2025-05-13 15:20:00] - Open Questions/Issues:
    - Campaign Details page shows dummy data, needs to load actual CSV data.
    - Campaigns marked 'active' are not yet making calls (campaign engine/worker issue).
    - Real-time monitor page for campaigns is not functional.
*   [2025-05-12 18:05:00] - Added test route `/api/ping-recordings` to `db/api/recording-api.js` for debugging recording download/playback routing issues.

[2025-05-13 12:27:22] - **Session Summary: Frontend Build & Backend Deployment Stabilization**
    - **Initial Goal:** Investigate recording playback/download issues (later clarified as already fixed).
    - **Shifted Focus:** Stabilize frontend build and resolve backend deployment errors on Render.
    - **Frontend Build Fixes:**
        - Resolved numerous TypeScript errors across various components (`CallDetailsPage`, `EnhancedRealTimeTranscript`, `RealTimeTranscript`, `RecordingsList`, `Calendar`, `Toaster/useToast`, `mongodb-contacts.ts`) related to incorrect prop names, type definitions, and outdated component APIs (e.g., `react-day-picker` icon components).
        - Addressed Next.js static generation errors by:
            - Wrapping pages using `useSearchParams` (`/campaigns/bulk-add`, `/campaigns/real-time-monitor`) in `<Suspense>` boundaries.
            - Dynamically importing the form component in `/reports/new` with SSR disabled to resolve `react-hook-form` related prerendering errors.
            - Ensured all necessary imports (e.g., `Skeleton`) were present.
    - **Backend Deployment Fix (Render):**
        - Identified `FST_ERR_PLUGIN_VERSION_MISMATCH` for `@fastify/helmet` due to incompatibility with Fastify v4.
        - Downgraded `@fastify/helmet` from `^13.0.1` to `^11.1.1`.
        - Pushed all frontend and backend dependency fixes to the `development` branch.
    - **Current Status:**
        - Frontend `npm run build` completes successfully.
        - Render backend deployment starts successfully with the downgraded `@fastify/helmet`.
        - User confirmed local frontend testing against production backend shows core functionalities (calls, history, recordings playback/download) are working.
    - **Mode Switch:** Switched from Architect to Code mode to execute `npm` and `git` commands.
