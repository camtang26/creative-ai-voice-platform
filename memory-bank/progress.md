[2025-05-13 12:28:07] - **Task Completed: Stabilize Frontend Build and Backend Deployment**
    - **Summary:** Successfully resolved a series of critical frontend TypeScript build errors and Next.js static generation issues. Addressed a backend deployment failure on Render caused by a Fastify plugin version mismatch.
    - **Key Fixes Implemented:**
        - Corrected numerous type errors in frontend components (props, interfaces, component APIs).
        - Implemented `<Suspense>` boundaries for pages using dynamic rendering hooks (`useSearchParams`).
        - Used dynamic imports (`next/dynamic` with `ssr: false`) for components causing static generation errors with `react-hook-form`.
        - Downgraded `@fastify/helmet` package to `^11.1.1` to ensure compatibility with Fastify v4.x used in the backend.
    - **Outcome:**
        - Frontend `npm run build` now completes without errors.
        - Backend server on Render starts successfully.
        - Core application functionalities (calls, history, recordings) confirmed working with local frontend against production backend.
    - **Next Steps:** Project is now in a stable state for further development or testing.

[2025-05-13 15:20:00] - **Task Completed: Debug and Fix CSV Campaign Creation & Campaign Details Page**
    - **Summary:** Resolved a series of issues preventing successful campaign creation via CSV upload and fixed errors on the campaign details page.
    - **Key Fixes Implemented:**
        - Addressed Fastify plugin version mismatches and configuration for multipart form data handling.
        - Corrected frontend logic for `useState` ("use client" directive).
        - Ensured proper `formData` population in `upload-sheet-form.tsx`.
        - Fixed Mongoose validation error for campaign status (used 'draft' instead of 'pending').
        - Corrected `_id` to `id` mapping and data unwrapping in frontend API calls (`fetchCampaigns`, `fetchCampaign`).
    - **Outcome:**
        - CSV upload now successfully creates campaigns.
        - Campaign Details page loads data (currently dummy data, real data loading pending).
    - **Next Steps (Campaigns Feature - Deferred):**
        - Implement loading of actual CSV contact data into campaign details view.
        - Investigate and fix why 'active' campaigns are not initiating calls (campaign engine).
        - Fix the real-time campaign monitor page.

[2025-05-13 15:20:00] - **New Current Task: Implement Post-Call Webhook for CRM Integration**
    - **Goal:** Develop a mechanism to send call metadata (phone number, contact name, summary, status, duration) to an external CRM endpoint (`https://qr4h1dage6.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/crm/calls/webhook/is`) via HTTP POST after each call completes.
    - **Source:** Request from tech lead (Craig).
    - **Details:** Payload should be JSON, e.g., `{"type":"conversationAICall", "subject":"...", "to":"...", ...}`.
