# Dashboard MongoDB Integration

This document details the implementation of MongoDB integration for the front page dashboard components, replacing mock data with real-time data from the MongoDB backend.

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Created Dashboard API Client
- Created a new `dashboard-api.ts` file with functions to fetch dashboard data
- Implemented proper error handling and TypeScript types
- Added support for fetching realtime data

### 2. Enhanced Stats Cards
- Updated the `EnhancedStatsCards` component to fetch real data
- Added loading states for better user experience
- Implemented automatic refresh for active call count
- Connected to the MongoDB dashboard API endpoints

### 3. Call Activity Chart
- Updated the `EnhancedCallsChart` component to fetch real call activity data
- Added period filtering with API integration
- Implemented loading and empty states
- Optimized data display for both call volume and duration views

### 4. Recent Calls List
- Updated the `EnhancedRecentCalls` component to fetch real recent calls
- Added Socket.IO integration for real-time updates
- Implemented manual refresh functionality
- Added proper loading states and error handling

### 5. Utilities
- Added `getApiUrl()` utility function to centralize API URL handling
- Enhanced existing utility functions for better formatting

## API Endpoints Used

The implementation uses the following MongoDB API endpoints:

- `/api/db/dashboard/overview` - For dashboard summary and recent calls
- `/api/db/dashboard/realtime` - For active calls and today's statistics
- `/api/db/dashboard/activity` - For call activity chart data

## Socket.IO Integration

- The Recent Calls component listens for Socket.IO events to update in real time
- New calls and status changes are immediately reflected in the UI
- The implementation handles disconnections and reconnections gracefully

## Error Handling and Fallbacks

- All API calls include comprehensive error handling
- Components provide meaningful feedback when data cannot be loaded
- The UI degrades gracefully when API endpoints are unavailable

## Next Steps

1. Continue with remaining dashboard components:
   - Analytics page with real data
   - Reports page with exportable reports
   - Campaign details with real-time updates

2. Further enhance real-time functionality:
   - Add more detailed Socket.IO event handlers
   - Implement push notifications for important events
   - Add real-time filtering and search capabilities

3. Optimize performance:
   - Implement client-side caching for frequently used data
   - Add pagination for large data sets
   - Optimize rendering for better performance
