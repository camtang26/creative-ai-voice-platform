  - Added filters for data selection by date, type, status

- **Enhanced API Integration**:
  - Extended API service with comprehensive endpoints for analytics data
  - Added campaign management API functions
  - Implemented report generation and export APIs

## Technical Decisions

1. **Component Architecture**:
   - Created reusable visualization components that can be composed for different analytics views
   - Implemented shared filtering context for consistent data presentation
   - Used tabs for organization of complex data views

2. **Data Flow Architecture**:
   - Implemented consistent data fetching pattern with loading/error states
   - Created transformation utilities for chart data preparation
   - Used placeholder data with realistic structures for development

3. **UI/UX Design**:
   - Maintained consistent dashboard styling
   - Implemented responsive layouts for all new pages
   - Used appropriate visualizations for different metric types
   - Added clear navigation hierarchy for complex sections

## Enhanced API Integration

The following API endpoints were added or extended:

```javascript
// Analytics Endpoints
fetchConversationAnalytics(filters)
fetchAgentPerformance(filters)

// Campaign Management
saveCampaign(campaign)
fetchCampaigns()
fetchCampaign(campaignId)
startCampaign(campaignId)
pauseCampaign(campaignId)
cancelCampaign(campaignId)

// Reporting
saveReport(report)
fetchReports()
fetchReport(reportId)
generateReport(reportId, format)

// Export
exportData(type, options)
uploadSheetForCampaign(file)
```

## New Type Definitions

To support the new features, the following types were added:

```typescript
// Analytics Types
ConversationAnalytics
AgentPerformance
AnalyticsTimeframe
AnalyticsFilters

// Campaign Types
CampaignConfig
CampaignStats

// Reporting Types
ReportConfig
```

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Challenge**: Creating reusable chart components that work with different data shapes.
   **Solution**: Implemented data transformation utilities within each component to standardize data formats.

2. **Challenge**: Balancing real API integration with development using sample data.
   **Solution**: Created consistent API interfaces with fallback to sample data, making it easy to switch to real API calls.

3. **Challenge**: Managing complex state in form interfaces like campaign and report creation.
   **Solution**: Used React useState hooks with careful state organization and step-based UIs for complex forms.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Analytics**:
   - Voice sentiment analysis visualization
   - Machine learning-based conversation quality scoring
   - Predictive analytics for call outcome prediction

2. **Campaign Optimization**:
   - A/B testing for different agent prompts
   - Automatic time optimization based on response rates
   - Integration with CRM systems for campaign targeting

3. **Report Enhancements**:
   - Interactive dashboards with drill-down capabilities
   - Custom metric definitions and calculations
   - Advanced data export with custom formatting

## Conclusion

Phase 4 has successfully transformed the ElevenLabs Calling Dashboard into a comprehensive analytics and campaign management platform. The new features provide deep insights into conversation quality, agent performance, and campaign effectiveness, while enabling easy management of outbound calling campaigns and flexible reporting options.

These enhancements significantly increase the value of the platform by providing actionable analytics, streamlined campaign management, and comprehensive reporting capabilities. The architecture is designed to easily integrate with real ElevenLabs analytics data once available, while providing a functional interface during development.
