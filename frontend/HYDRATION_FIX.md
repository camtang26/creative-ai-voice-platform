# React Hydration Error Fix

## Issue

The application was encountering a React hydration error on the Live Calls page:

```
Warning: Text content did not match. Server: "5:41:56 am" Client: "5:41:57 AM"
```

This occurs because the server-rendered HTML doesn't match what the client-side JavaScript renders when it "hydrates" the page. The specific mismatch was in the time format:

1. Different seconds (56 vs 57) - This is expected as time passes between server and client rendering
2. Different AM/PM formatting (lowercase "am" vs uppercase "AM")

## Fix Applied

We updated the `live-calls/page.tsx` file to ensure consistent time formatting between server and client by:

1. Defining explicit time formatting options:
```javascript
const timeFormatOptions: Intl.DateTimeFormatOptions = {
  hour: 'numeric',
  minute: 'numeric',
  second: 'numeric',
  hour12: true
};
```

2. Using these options consistently with a specific locale in all `toLocaleTimeString()` calls:
```javascript
// Before
new Date().toLocaleTimeString()

// After
new Date().toLocaleTimeString('en-US', timeFormatOptions)
```

This ensures that the server and client will use the exact same formatting rules, preventing the hydration mismatch.

## Why Hydration Errors Matter

Hydration errors can cause:
1. Performance issues - React needs to discard server-rendered HTML and re-render
2. Visual flickering as content is replaced
3. Potential loss of state
4. Console errors and warnings

## Best Practices to Avoid Hydration Errors

1. Always specify explicit formatting options for dates, times, and numbers
2. Use the same locale ('en-US') consistently
3. Avoid relying on default browser locale settings
4. For dynamic content that depends on time:
   - Consider using a client-only approach with `useEffect`
   - Or implement techniques like progressive hydration
