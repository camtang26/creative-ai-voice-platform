# Fixing the Undefined Component Error in Live Calls Page

We've identified and fixed an issue with the Live Calls page where you were encountering an error:

```
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```

## Changes Made:

1. **Simplified Component Import**
   - Changed the dynamic import of LiveCallsGrid to a static import
   - This ensures the component is available during initial render

```javascript
// Before:
const LiveCallsGrid = dynamic(
  () => import('@/components/live-calls-grid').then((mod) => mod.LiveCallsGrid),
  { ssr: false }
);

// After:
import { LiveCallsGrid } from '@/components/live-calls-grid';
```

2. **Cleared Next.js Build Cache**
   - Removed the `.next` directory to clear any cached build artifacts
   - This ensures a clean build with the latest component changes

## Why This Works

In Next.js App Router, dynamic imports can sometimes cause issues with component resolution, especially when:

1. The component is used inside a client component
2. There are multiple imports of the same component with different methods
3. There might be circular dependencies in the component tree

Using a direct import ensures the component is properly loaded and recognized by React before rendering.

## Additional Steps Taken

1. Verified that all components (`LiveCallsGrid`, `ActiveCallCard`, etc.) have proper exports
2. Confirmed that the socket context provider is functioning correctly
3. Ensured proper types are defined for all component props

## How to Test

1. Start the backend server: `.\start-enhanced.bat`
2. Start the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Navigate to the Live Calls page at: http://localhost:3000/live-calls

The page should now load without any errors.

## If Issues Persist

If you continue to experience issues with the Live Calls page or any other component, please try these additional steps:

1. **Update Dependencies**
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm update
   ```

2. **Check for TypeScript Errors**
   ```
   cd frontend
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```

3. **Full Project Rebuild**
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```

These steps will help ensure all components are correctly compiled and available for rendering in the application.
